<h1>#SmartDeskLight</h1>

<h2>This is a SmartDeskLight created using RP2040 Zero and ESP8266 12F microcontrollers.</h2>
Apart from these 2 microcontrollers, it uses RGB LEDs controlled via PWM signals, Hot Glue Sticks
and a damaged servo motor's case.<br>

The ESP8266 hosts a website for changing color of lamp's LEDs, which can be accessed either by connecting the module to a wifi Network or by connecting to the
module itself using it as an AP.
